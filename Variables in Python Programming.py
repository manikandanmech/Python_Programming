#Variables in Python Programming
"""
In programming, a "variable" is a container in which a data value can be stored within the computerâ€™s memory.
"""
#Syntax:
variable_name = variable_value

#Example:
a = 10
name = "Joes"

>>>> rules for creating and using variables in Python:

* Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. They cannot start with a number.
* Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful, and should not contain spaces. 
* It's common to separate words in a variable name with an underscore.
* Variable names should not conflict with Python keywords, such as print, if, or for.
* Python is case sensitive, so name and Name are considered two different variables.
* A variable must be assigned a value before it can be used.
